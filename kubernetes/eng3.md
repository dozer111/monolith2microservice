My last vacation

So, it was last summer. My friend Dmytro has invited me to Odessa, and I have accepted.
My bride also has accepted to go. We planned to go to Zatoka. 
We(I with bride) had been starting to prepare to it near 1 month before vacation.
We
* saved some money for it
* prepared our dresses
* bought special medicine
* and, of cource booked a room

Dmytro has also invited some other people. He planned to go here with me, Vasyl,
Roman and Egor. Roman couldn`t go with us. So, we have planned to go in 6 people(
Dima + bride, I + bride, Vasyl, Egor).

In day X all of us have gone to the place. I with my bride went to place by train, Dima
ran by car, and Vasia with Egor went by bus. It was hard journey. Near 10 hours in train.
We was just sitting and looking in the window. So, some time after we started journey,
we finally arrived in Odessa. We didn\`t hurry to Zatoka. First of all, we went to 
the Mc\`Donals. Then, we were sitting some time, and finally we started to find the bus to the place.
We found the bus quickly. And, seems that easy journey, but no. There were big traffic jams.
We had been moving for 5 minutes, before had been stopping for half an hour, and move
5 minutes more and etc. So, finally, we have arrived to place. We quickly found out hotel, and
manager quickly took keys to us. That was really boring and hard day.

In the 3 or 4 morning next day Vasyl and Egor have arrived too. We met them at dinner.
They was very happy, and wanted to eat sth. We went to the show. Than, we had dinner,
and went rest for 2 hours, because it was dangerous between noon and 3 p.m

After rest we went to the beach. Finally, we swam in the black sea. It was exciting.
After some time I was tired, and went from the sea. My bride wasn\`t tired, so she kept swimming.

So, I was sitting on the dust, and no nothing, while she was swimming. It was cool.

We went to beach every day. We had some interesting events every day.

Every day we had been swimming from morning till noon. Than we went eat.
